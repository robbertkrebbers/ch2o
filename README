PREREQUISITES
-------------

This version is known to compile with:

 - Coq 8.4  
 - SCons 2.0

BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------

Say "scons" to build the full library, or "scons some_module.vo" to just 
build some_module.vo (and its dependencies).

In addition to common Make options like -j N and -k, SCons supports some 
useful options of its own, such as --debug=time, which displays the time 
spent executing individual build commands.

scons -c replaces Make clean
